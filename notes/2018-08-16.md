- This file itself is a markdown file - think of it as a good way to write notes
  - https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
  - It's good because it looks OK as text and also renders to HTML
    - Visual Studio Code has a Markdown preview mode

Background
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML

- HTML (hyper text markup language) uses *elements* that look like `<blah>` to organize data
  - You might be familiar with `<b>` for bold text, or `<img>` for an image
- HTML5 is the latest available - if you haven't worked with HTML in a while, catching up's no problem
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5
- [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources) and [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/)) are actually just `specifications`
  - Browser makers work with these specs to create their browsers
    - https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/
    - Sometimes there can be inconsistencies but [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/) is a good reference for what works where

### JavaScript

TODO: Summary

### React

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a [JavaScript framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_framework)
  - A "framework" is a set of code that defines how the rest of the app should be written
  - A "library" is a collection of tools that can be used 
    - [Underscore JS](https://underscorejs.org/) is a popular library that we'll probably use soon
    - A good way to think about frameworks & libraries is that they were made to solve general(-ish) problems common to any app
